o Effectively Communicating Numbers (pg 1-13)

This process consists of the following six fundamental stages:

  1. Determine your message and identify the data necessary to communicate it.
  2. Determine if a table, graph, or combination of both is needed to communicate your message.
  The remaining stages apply only if one or more graphs are required.
  3. Determine the best means to encode the values.
  4. Determine where to display each variable.
  5. Determine the best design for the remaining objects.
  6. Determine if particular data should be featured above the rest, and if so, how.

Categorical: Nomial, Ordinal, Interval

Graphs

  1. Time Series
  2. Ranking Relationships
  3. Part to Whole
  4. Deviation Relationships
  5. Distribution relationships
  6. Correlation
  7. Nominal

Avoid Area or Volume relationship: Linear is best

o Hans Rosling: The best stats youâ€™ve ever seen

  1. Aggrigate vs deaggrigated data
  2. Time and bubble trends
  3. gapminder
  4. Make data available
  5. Log scales to make it look linear
  
o Questions and best data science

  1. Ask questions that matter
  2. Know when the question has been answered logically
  3. Know when the question has been answered creativally
      test your solution and try to make it fail
